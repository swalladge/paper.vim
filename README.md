## About

A light colour scheme designed with the following goals:

1. usable in high glare conditions
2. look like writing and annotations on paper
3. be simple: no configuration, custom terminal colours, etc.

NOTE: this is not yet complete - there are still more highlight-groups to add
and configure, and more colour tweaks I want to make. Feel free to take it for
a test drive, but it will feel incomplete.

Should work out of the box for 256 colour terminals and 24bit gui/terminals.

Inspired by [papercolor-theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme)

## Installation

`:h packages` or use a package manager of your choice.

## Usage

```
:colorscheme paper
```


## Configuration

This is a lean mean colorscheme. There is no configuration. If you want to
customize the colours, you are free to fork the repository and make changes as
you wish (see development info below). Please consider making a pull request
back to the original repository if you feel your changes may benefit the wider
community.


## Development

This colour scheme is developed using romainl's [erb
template](https://gist.github.com/romainl/5cd2f4ec222805f49eca). Ruby must be
installed (for the `erb` command).

Edit the variables in `colors/paper.erb` and run `make` to build
`colors/paper.vim`. `colors/paper.vim` should not be edited directly.
